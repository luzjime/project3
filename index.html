    <p>The Plaka District is the oldest neighborhood in Athens. Its charming narrow streets are filled with shops, cafes, and neoclassical homes. It’s a great place to stroll around and enjoy Greek culture up close. Most people are super nice and will be very welcoming, too. Also, there's some beautiful trees and flowers all around, so the views are stunning!</p>

    <p>This majestic temple dedicated to the sea god Poseidon stands atop Cap Sounion, offering epic views of the Aegean Sea. Ever since it was built, it's been known as a major landmark for sailors returning home. Not as much now, but it now is probaby one of the most scenic spots in all of Greece.</p>

    <p>The Parthenon, dedicated to the goddess Athena--the goddess of Wisdom and Battle Strategy--sits atop the Acropolis and stands as a masterpiece of ancient architecture. It’s one of the most recognized monuments in the world. It is rumored that there used to be a statue of the goddess in the temple, but that over time, it disappeared. Various individuals speculate that it could've been stolen, destroyed, or even hidden. Nobody knows what happened to the statue, but they say it was absolutely stunning!</p>
